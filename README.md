## Overview
For the love of sales and Excel! Mexican Toys stores is a fictitious company that has different product categories with stores located in different areas of the city and the team urgently needs a dashboard that allows them to monitor sales trend, know how much stock is being tied up at each store location, how much revenue has been made over time etc.
The Excel Sales dashboard is a dynamic and interactive dashboard that allows the team to determine trends or patterns in sales, the revenue and profit made by the company from 2017 to Q3 2018 across various locations and for each product category. 

## Data Source
* This is a sample dataset from Maven Analytics. (https://mavenanalytics.io/data-playground?search=Toy)

## Activities Performed For During This Project
*	KPI Identification
*	Data Cleaning – Removal of unnecessary columns, checked for primary key duplication for certain tables provided (sales table), data type formatting using Power Query and 
  loading the data into Power Pivot.
*	Data Modelling/Relationship Creation: I used the PowerPivot feature to create relationships between the four tables provided.
*	Data Analysis: This was achieved using Pivot Tables and Power Pivot. Measures and other column calculations were performed within the Power Pivot environment.
*	Data Reporting/Dashboarding: Each visualization was done using the Pivot Chart and other chart elements within Excel.

## Analysis and Insights

Below are some major analysis and insights uncovered from the dataset

### 1.	How much money did the company make from 2017 to Q3 2018?

The company made **$14,444,572** from sales within the period in review.

### 2.	Are there any sales trends or patterns in the data?

Absolutely! An upward sales trend was observed from 2017 to Q3 2018, and the analysis revealed a year-over-year (YOY) quarterly sales growth of **30.86%**. 
*(See YOY quarterly sales growth analysis in the ‘Analysis Sheet’ of the Workbook)*

Additionally, a consistent pattern emerged with a decline in sales during Q3 of each year, particularly in the month of August and it is worth noting that sales consistently peaked in the second quarter of each year. 

*(Please refer to the main dashboard for a visual interaction)*

(Note: The dataset excludes Q4 2018 sales information. The YOY quarterly growth calculation is based on comparing total sales in the first three quarters of 2017 to the corresponding period in 2018. It's important to highlight that the dataset does not encompass Q4 2018 sales data)


### 3.	Which product category drive the biggest profits? Is this the same across store locations?

Overall, the Toys product category drove the biggest profit for the store, topping the profit chart by 26.89%, followed by the Electronics product category with a 24.95% contribution to gross profit. 

Stores situated in the commercial and airport areas got their biggest profits from electronics sales, whereas stores located in Downtown and Residential areas saw their most substantial profits from the sale of toys. 


### 4.	How much money is tied up in inventory at the toy stores?

From 2017 to Q3 2018, the store had a total of 29742 available stock items, and the amount tied up in inventory was $410,241.

*(Note: Please interact with the dashboard to see available stock for each product category in each location)*

## Project Limitation
Not enough data to validate sales pattern or trends, and the dataset does not cover Q4 2018 sales. The inclusion of Q4 2O18 data would have helped in providing a holistic view of the annual sales growth. "Something like comparing apples to apples, you get what I mean?"

If you have gotten this far in my write-up, thanks so much, and what do you think about this mini project?
